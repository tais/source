# SDL3 Port Plan

Tracking doc for migrating JA2 1.13 off Win32 / DirectDraw / FMOD / Smacker
onto SDL3 + cross-platform equivalents, with a 32-bit RGBA8888 internal
rendering pipeline.

This lives on the `sdl3-port` branch. `master` is left untouched.

## Status at a glance

| Phase | Description | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Branch + plan doc | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Build system portability — configures, compiles, and links on macOS | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Portable file I/O / time / memory / debug | Partial via compat shims; real porting pending |
| 3 | SDL3 window + event loop, drop WinMain | Not started |
| 4 | SDL3 input, drop DirectInput / Win32 hooks | Not started |
| 5 | SDL3 video (RGB565 transitional), retire DirectDraw | Not started |
| 6 | RGBA8888 pipeline, rewrite blitters, kill inline asm | Not started |
| 7 | Audio — SDL3_mixer / SoLoud, drop FMOD | Not started |
| 8 | Cinematics — libsmacker, decide on Bink | Not started |
| 9 | Fonts — stb_truetype, drop GDI | Not started |
| 10 | Platform packaging + CI | Not started |
| ∞ | Multiplayer — port to RakNet 4 or netlib swap | Deferred indefinitely |

As of Phase 1 closing, the build hits `[100%] Built target JA2_ENGLISH`
on macOS. The resulting binary prints a "not yet implemented" notice
and exits — nothing renders, nothing accepts input, nothing plays
audio. **Every Win32-gated block in the codebase corresponds to a
named phase below**; that's the work plan.

## Goals

- Native builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux (all first-class).
- No DirectX, no Win32 GUI/audio APIs, no Wine workarounds, no cnc-ddraw
  shim. The `wine/` subdirectory goes away.
- Internal rendering pipeline is RGBA8888 (32-bit). RGB565 surfaces,
  16-bit palette LUTs, and the inline-asm RGB565 alpha blender are
  retired.
- Audio (SFX, music, Smacker cinematics) replaced with portable
  libraries in this same effort.
- Build system is CMake-only and fetches its dependencies (no
  pre-built `.lib` blobs checked into the repo).

## Non-goals (for this branch)

- Refactoring game logic beyond what the API changes force.
- Touching the modding/INI/Lua interfaces.
- Rewriting the editor as a separate concern — it must keep building
  but is not the focus.
- Networking (Multiplayer) beyond keeping it linking; SDL_net swap is
  out of scope.

## Approach

Land the work in independent, reviewable phases. Each phase should
leave the branch in a buildable state on at least Windows, and the
later phases should leave it buildable on all three targets. Each
phase below is roughly a PR-sized chunk and will be broken into
several commits.

The strategy is **strangler-fig**: introduce the SDL3 surface
underneath the existing SGP API, then swap one subsystem at a time,
deleting the Win32 implementation as each subsystem is migrated. The
SGP public API (what the rest of the game calls) stays mostly stable;
the implementation behind it is what changes.

---

## How Phase 1 was actually closed

Phase 1's exit criterion turned out to be more invasive than the
original plan anticipated. Rather than write SDL3 code in this phase,
we landed an extensive **gating + compat-stub layer** so the existing
Win32/DirectDraw/FMOD code is preserved verbatim under `#ifdef _WIN32`
and non-Windows builds get either:

- Inline stubs (for typedefs and small helpers) defined in
  [sgp/msvc_compat.h](../sgp/msvc_compat.h), or
- No-op function definitions (for whole subsystems like Multiplayer).

This means **on Windows nothing changed at runtime**. On non-Windows
the build compiles and links but most subsystems are non-functional
until their respective phase replaces the gated blocks with real
SDL3-backed implementations.

### The compat header — `sgp/msvc_compat.h`

Single biggest piece of new code. Active only on non-Windows. Provides:

- **Win32 unsized typedefs**: `BOOL`, `UINT`, `INT`, `ULONG`, `LONG`,
  `WORD`, `USHORT`, `DWORD`, `BYTE`, `CHAR`, `WCHAR`, `UCHAR`,
  `LONGLONG`, `ULONGLONG`, `HANDLE`, `LPVOID`, `LPSTR`, `LPCSTR`,
  `LPWSTR`, `LPCWSTR`, `LPDWORD`, `VOID`.
- **Win32 structs**: `FILETIME`, `RECT`, `RGBQUAD`, `SYSTEMTIME`,
  `WIN32_FIND_DATA`, `LARGE_INTEGER` (union with `QuadPart`),
  `CRITICAL_SECTION`, `MEMORYSTATUS`, `TIMECAPS`.
- **`MAX_PATH`** as `PATH_MAX`.
- **Min/max**: `__min`, `__max`, `min`, `max` macros (POSIX has them
  but lowercase `min`/`max` conflict with `std::min`/`std::max`; we
  pick the ternary-macro form for compat with Windows behavior).
- **String/array**: `_countof`, `_stricmp`/`_strnicmp`/`_wcsicmp`
  mapped to `strcasecmp`/`strncasecmp`/`wcscasecmp`, `_strupr` /
  `_strlwr` / `_wcsupr` / `_wcslwr` written as ASCII-range loops,
  `_itow` / `_ltow` hand-rolled, `_wtoi` as `wcstol`, `wcstok_2arg`
  shim mapping MSVC's 2-arg form onto POSIX's 3-arg form, `sprintf_s`
  as `snprintf`, `MAXUINT8/16/32` macros.
- **swprintf macro** routing through a `sgp_compat::arrsize` template
  that pulls the array extent at compile time. Pointer-buffer call
  sites that legitimately need explicit size use **`sgp_swprintf`** —
  defined at the bottom of the file, available cross-platform.
- **`vswprintf` template overload** for the same array-extent trick.
- **Win32 string conversion stubs**: `MultiByteToWideChar` /
  `WideCharToMultiByte` return 0 (failure). `CP_ACP` / `CP_UTF8`
  macros. *Phase 5–7 should replace these with `std::codecvt` or
  `iconv`.*
- **Time stubs**: `GetTickCount` via `std::chrono::steady_clock`,
  `Sleep` via `std::this_thread::sleep_for`, `timeBeginPeriod` /
  `timeEndPeriod` / `timeSetEvent` / `timeKillEvent` as no-ops,
  `QueryPerformanceFrequency` / `QueryPerformanceCounter` via
  `std::chrono::steady_clock`, `GetCurrentThreadId` returns 1.
- **Thread/event stubs (BIG WARNING)**: `CreateThread` returns NULL —
  the JA2 clock thread and notify thread don't actually run on
  non-Windows. `CreateEvent` / `SetEvent` / `ResetEvent` /
  `WaitForSingleObject` / `WaitForMultipleObjects[Ex]` /
  `CloseHandle` are no-ops returning `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. Critical-section
  ops are no-ops on a tiny struct.
- **File I/O stubs (BIG WARNING)**: `CreateFile` returns
  `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` / `SetFilePointer`
  / `GetFileSize` / `FormatMessage` are no-ops. **SLF library reading
  will not work** until Phase 2 ports `LibraryDataBase.cpp` to use
  `std::ifstream`.
- **Heap stubs**: `GetProcessHeap` returns sentinel, `HeapAlloc` /
  `HeapFree` route through `malloc`/`free`, `VirtualAlloc` /
  `VirtualFree` / `VirtualLock` / `VirtualUnlock` route through
  `malloc`/`free` (lock semantics dropped).
- **Error codes**: `ERROR_SUCCESS`, `ERROR_NOT_READY`,
  `ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER`. `GetLastError` returns 0.
- **`OutputDebugString[A|W]`** emit to `stderr`.
- **`__debugbreak`** as `__builtin_trap`.
- **`ZeroMemory`** as `memset(_, 0, _)`.
- **`_abs64`** as `llabs`.
- **`GetPrivateProfileString[A]`** stub that writes the supplied
  default. *Phase 2 should remove this when the legacy INI helpers
  are dropped.*
- **`OPEN_EXISTING` / `GENERIC_READ` etc.**: full set of Win32 file
  flag constants for compile-time use.

When any of these gets a real cross-platform implementation in its
phase, the compat shim should be deleted to avoid drift.

### Gated subsystems

The big picture: every Win32-specific subsystem now compiles to an
empty translation unit (or stub) on non-Windows. Listed by which phase
will revive them:

#### Phase 2 — file I/O / time / memory

- [sgp/FileMan.cpp](../sgp/FileMan.cpp): direct `<io.h>` /
  `<direct.h>` / `<windows.h>` gated. Uses `WIN32_FIND_DATA`,
  `CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, `SetFilePointer`, etc. — currently routes
  through the compat stubs which fail. **Phase 2 rewrites on
  `std::filesystem` / `<cstdio>`** with case-insensitive resolution
  for asset paths (mirror Stracciatella's known-good implementation).
- [sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp](../sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp): SLF archive
  reader. Same story — uses Win32 file APIs via the compat stubs.
  Phase 2 ports to portable streams. The `_splitpath` site has a
  basename-by-last-slash fallback at line ~984.
- [sgp/MemMan.cpp](../sgp/MemMan.cpp): `<windows.h>` gated. The
  `_DEBUG && _MSC_VER` heap-tracking branch falls through to plain
  malloc on non-MSVC.
- [sgp/timer.cpp](../sgp/timer.cpp): `Clock` callback and
  `SetTimer` / `KillTimer` gated. Non-Windows reads `GetTickCount`
  (compat shim) directly. Phase 2 should provide a proper monotonic
  timer.
- [Utils/Timer Control.cpp](../Utils/Timer%20Control.cpp): the
  JA2 clock thread + notify thread machinery uses Win32 events,
  mutexes, and `timeSetEvent` callbacks. Currently those are all
  no-op compat stubs — **the clock thread doesn't tick on non-Windows**,
  so anything counting on `guiBaseJA2Clock` advancing is broken.
  Phase 2 rebuilds on `std::thread` + `std::chrono` + `std::mutex` +
  `std::condition_variable`. SEH `__try`/`__except`/`__finally`
  blocks gated on `_MSC_VER`.
- [sgp/Random.cpp](../sgp/Random.cpp): `<windows.h>` and the
  `GetCursorPos` cursor-position seed contribution are gated.
- [sgp/DEBUG.cpp](../sgp/DEBUG.cpp): the assertion message pump that
  pumps `PeekMessage` is gated; non-Windows path just calls
  `GameLoop` until `gfProgramIsRunning` flips. SEH blocks gated on
  `_MSC_VER`. The `<crtdbg.h>` include is gated on `_MSC_VER`.

#### Phase 3 — window, event loop, message plumbing

- [sgp/sgp.cpp](../sgp/sgp.cpp): the **entire 1410-line file** is
  gated behind `_WIN32`. `WinMain`, `WindowProcedure`, the window
  class registration, the cnc-ddraw detection (`bCncDdraw`), the
  `iScreenMode` / windowed/fullscreen plumbing, the dll-override-by-
  Wine helper — all of it. The non-Windows replacement is a stub
  `main()` at the bottom of the file. **Phase 3 writes a portable
  `SDL_main` that calls `SDL_CreateWindow`, runs `SDL_PollEvent`
  fanning into JA2's event queue, and dispatches into the game loop.**
- [wine/](../wine/): the registry-poking Wine DLL override helper.
  Already excluded from non-Windows builds by the top-level
  CMakeLists `if(WIN32)`. Phase 3 deletes the directory once SDL3
  replaces DirectDraw entirely.
- [sgp/video.h](../sgp/video.h): `HWND ghWindow` and the
  `LPDIRECTDRAW2 GetDirectDraw2Object()`-style getters are behind
  `_WIN32`. Phase 3 introduces a portable accessor for the window
  handle (likely `SDL_Window*` directly, or an opaque pointer).
- `MessageBox` / `ShowWindow` / `SetCursor` call sites across the
  codebase. Phase 3 swaps to `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox` /
  `SDL_HideCursor` / `SDL_SetCursor`.

#### Phase 4 — input

- [sgp/input.cpp](../sgp/input.cpp): `KeyboardHandler` /
  `MouseHandler` Win32 hook procedures (`LRESULT CALLBACK`),
  `SetWindowsHookEx` / `UnhookWindowsHookEx`, `CallNextHookEx`,
  `MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT` consumer, `WM_*` switch — all gated `_WIN32`.
  `HHOOK` globals gated too. `RestrictMouseCursor` / `FreeMouseCursor`
  / `RestoreCursorClipRect` / `GetRestrictedClipCursor` /
  `SimulateMouseMovement` cursor-clipping gated. `DequeueAllKeyBoardEvents`
  `PeekMessage` pump gated. SEH `__try`/`__except`/`__finally` blocks
  gated on `_MSC_VER`. `GetCursorPos` mouse-poll sites all replaced
  with `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` fallback on non-Windows.
- [Utils/KeyMap.cpp](../Utils/KeyMap.cpp): the entire VK_* virtual-
  key-code translation table (160 constants) is gated `_WIN32`.
  **Phase 4 must rebuild this on `SDL_Scancode` while preserving the
  numeric VK_* values for save-game compatibility** (those values are
  persisted in savegames and config files).
- [Utils/Text Input.cpp](../Utils/Text%20Input.cpp): `PasteClipboardText`
  / `CopyToClipboard` (Win32 clipboard) gated; non-Windows stubs
  return 0 / no-op. Phase 4 wires them to `SDL_GetClipboardText` /
  `SDL_SetClipboardText`.
- 12+ `GetCursorPos` / `ScreenToClient` sites in screen-handler
  files (Ja2/FeaturesScreen, Ja2/gameloop, Laptop/BriefingRoom*,
  Laptop/laptop, Laptop/personnel, Laptop/MPChatScreen,
  Strategic/Map Screen Interface Bottom, Tactical/Turn Based Input,
  TileEngine/Tactical Placement GUI, Ja2/HelpScreen) all gated
  `_WIN32` with `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` fallback.

#### Phase 5 — video (DirectDraw → SDL3, keep RGB565 internally first)

- [sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp): entire 3317-line file gated
  `_WIN32`. The whole DirectDraw video subsystem.
- [sgp/vsurface.cpp](../sgp/vsurface.cpp): entire 2803-line file
  gated `_WIN32`. DirectDraw surface manager.
- [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.cpp](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.cpp) +
  [sgp/DirectX Common.cpp](../sgp/DirectX%20Common.cpp): wholly
  gated `_WIN32`.
- [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.h](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.h): wholly gated
  `_WIN32` so the `<ddraw.h>` pull doesn't reach non-Windows.
- [sgp/ddraw.h](../sgp/ddraw.h), `ddraw.lib`, `fmodvc.lib`,
  `binkw32.lib`, `SMACKW32.LIB`, `mss32.lib` — only linked on
  Windows via the top-level CMakeLists `if(WIN32)`. Deleted in
  Phase 5 once SDL3 owns the surface stack.
- Phase 5 milestone: **game boots into main menu on macOS/Linux**,
  presenting the existing RGB565 framebuffer via `SDL_Texture` with
  `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB565`. End-to-end at least one battle playable.

#### Phase 6 — RGBA8888 pipeline

- [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp): all 77
  inline-asm blocks gated `_WIN32`. **Game renders blank on non-Windows
  until Phase 6 rewrites these as portable C/SIMD** against a 32-bit
  RGBA framebuffer.
- [TileEngine/renderworld.cpp](../TileEngine/renderworld.cpp): 10
  more inline-asm blocks (sprite blitters with Z-buffer handling).
- [sgp/shading.cpp](../sgp/shading.cpp): single inline-asm block.
- [Ja2/local.h](../Ja2/local.h): `PIXEL_DEPTH 16` constant. Phase 6
  changes to 32 and propagates.
- The 8bpp→16bpp palette LUTs, shading tables, translucency tables,
  fade tables — all need RGBA8888 regenerations.
- `GetRGBDistribution()` in video.cpp goes away (only relevant for
  RGB565 mask detection).

#### Phase 7 — audio

- [Utils/dsutil.cpp](../Utils/dsutil.cpp): entire DirectSound utility
  gated `_WIN32`. Phase 7 replaces with SDL3_mixer or SoLoud /
  miniaudio glue.
- [sgp/soundman.cpp](../sgp/soundman.cpp): the JA2 sound API. Uses
  FMOD throughout. Phase 7 keeps the public API stable but swaps the
  backend.
- `fmodvc.lib` / `mss32.lib` linkage already conditional on `WIN32`.
- [sgp/Mss.h](../sgp/Mss.h) and `Mss-old.h`: Miles Sound System
  headers. Phase 7 deletes once FMOD/MSS callers are migrated.

#### Phase 8 — cinematics

- [Utils/Cinematics.h](../Utils/Cinematics.h) / `.cpp` (Smacker):
  entirely gated `_WIN32`. Phase 8 replaces with libsmacker (MIT,
  open-source decoder for original Smacker format).
- [Utils/Cinematics Bink.h](../Utils/Cinematics%20Bink.h) / `.cpp`
  (Bink): entirely gated `_WIN32`. Phase 8 must decide between
  asset-conversion (Smacker/WebM), FFmpeg-with-license, or just
  skipping Bink cutscenes on non-Windows.
- [Ja2/Intro.cpp](../Ja2/Intro.cpp): the intro-screen video player —
  entire body gated `_WIN32`. Not currently dispatched to from gameplay
  (the `MAP_EXIT_TO_INTRO_SCREEN` switch is commented out everywhere),
  so the gate is safe.
- `binkw32.lib` / `SMACKW32.LIB` linkage already conditional on `WIN32`.

#### Phase 9 — fonts

- [sgp/WinFont.cpp](../sgp/WinFont.cpp): entire GDI-backed TrueType
  font rasterizer gated `_WIN32`. Phase 9 replaces with `stb_truetype`
  (single-header, public domain).
- [sgp/WinFont.h](../sgp/WinFont.h): non-Windows branch declares
  inline no-op stubs for `InitWinFonts`, `CreateWinFont`,
  `SetWinFontForeColor`, `PrintWinFont`, `GetWinFontHeight`, etc.
  Phase 9 replaces these with the stb_truetype implementations.
- [Utils/Font Control.cpp](../Utils/Font%20Control.cpp): two
  `InitWinFonts` / `ShutdownWinFonts` call sites gated `_WIN32`.

#### Phase 10 — packaging + CI

- Top-level [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt): `add_executable(... WIN32 ...)`
  could grow `MACOSX_BUNDLE` and Linux variants. Pre-built `.lib`
  files (`binkw32.lib`, `lua51.lib`, `SMACKW32.LIB`,
  `libexpatMT.lib`) already gated `if(WIN32)`. Pulling Lua, Expat,
  Bink (when replaced), Smacker (when replaced) from source on every
  platform is Phase 10 cleanup.
- CI matrix for Windows / macOS / Linux. App bundle / AppImage / zip
  packaging. None of this exists yet.

### Deferred indefinitely — Multiplayer

- JA2 uses **RakNet 3.401** as a Win32 prebuilt `.lib`
  (`Multiplayer/raknet/RakNetLibStatic.lib`, 5.3 MB). The matching
  3.x source isn't on any public mirror — Jenkins Software's SVN
  died with the company. Facebook open-sourced only 4.x
  ([facebookarchive/RakNet](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RakNet))
  and 4.x has substantial API breaks from 3.x (`RakNetworkFactory`
  removed, `AutoRPC` removed, `RPC()` gone, `BitStream` semantics
  changed, types namespaced).
- [Multiplayer/mp_stubs.cpp](../Multiplayer/mp_stubs.cpp) provides
  no-op definitions for every external symbol JA2 references from
  the network wrapper (~50 globals like `is_networked` /
  `is_connected`, ~70 functions like `send_path` / `send_fire` /
  `NetworkAutoStart`, plus `CTransferRules`). The `Multiplayer`
  CMake target builds `mp_stubs.cpp` on non-Windows; on Windows it
  builds the three wrapper files and links RakNet as before.
- Reviving multiplayer on non-Windows = vendoring RakNet 4 + porting
  JA2's wrapper code (~327 RakNet API references) per the upstream
  `3.x_to_4.x_upgrade.txt`, **or** retargeting to a different netlib
  (SDL3_net, enet, asio). Multi-day project either way.

### Other clang-strictness fixes landed in Phase 1

MSVC-tolerated patterns clang rejects, fixed as we hit them:

- **MSVC `__int64`** → `int64_t`/`uint64_t` from `<cstdint>`.
- **Stray `typename`** in template argument lists (popup_callback.h,
  Singleton.h, several other places).
- **`POPUP_OPTION::POPUP_OPTION(void)`** self-qualification on inline
  declarations.
- **`static`/non-static mismatch**: forward decls without `static`
  but defs with `static` (DisplayCover.cpp, Music Control.cpp,
  soundman.cpp, lua_env.cpp, lua_tactical.cpp).
- **Out-of-line template-member redeclarations** without body
  (BaseTable.h, DropDown.h, MilitiaWebsite.cpp).
- **Explicit template specialization after implicit instantiation**:
  forward-declared specializations at top of file (MilitiaWebsite.cpp).
- **Narrowing in brace initializers**: per-entry casts to the target
  type (Isometric Utils.cpp, Soldier Control.cpp), or rewrite as
  assignments (AimSort.cpp, BobbyR.cpp).
- **Pointer-to-smaller-int casts** on 64-bit: intermediate
  `(uintptr_t)` cast acknowledges the truncation (Vehicles.cpp,
  Strategic Movement.cpp, Soldier Control.cpp, soundman.cpp,
  FileMan.cpp).
- **Pointer-to-bool / pointer-to-zero comparisons**: rewritten with
  `!= NULL` (XML_ComboMergeInfo.cpp, XML_ItemAdjustments.cpp). The
  `SGP_THROW_IFFALSE` macro switched from `== false` to `!(cond)`.
- **String-literal-macro concatenation** needs a space between
  literal and identifier in C++11 (Button System.cpp).
- **MSVC `swprintf(buf, fmt, ...)` 2-arg signature** vs POSIX 3-arg:
  resolved by the `swprintf` macro + template helper. ~3000 call
  sites covered automatically; ~120 pointer-buffer sites converted
  to explicit `sgp_swprintf(buf, count, ...)`.
- **`SoldierID` ambiguous conversion**: added `long` /
  `unsigned long` constructors so `lua_Integer` (which is `long` on
  clang/libc++) finds an unambiguous match.
- **`_array` reserved name + dependent-base access** in
  sgp_auto_memory.h: dropped extra `typename`, added `this->_array`.
- **`Exception::what()` exception spec mismatch**: added `throw()`
  to definition to match header.
- **VFS macOS support**: ext/VFS/include/vfs/Core/vfs_types.h
  switched `__linux__` branch to default-non-Windows so Apple
  picks up the `<stdint.h>` typedefs.
- **libpng macOS support**: ext/libpng/pngconf.h classic-MacOS
  `<fp.h>` branch gated on `!__APPLE__`.
- **zlib macOS support**: ext/zlib/zutil.h classic-MacOS `fdopen`
  stub gated on `!__APPLE__`; gzguts.h includes `<unistd.h>` on
  non-Windows.

---

## Phase 0 — Branch & baseline ✅

Done.

- [docs/SDL3_PORT.md](SDL3_PORT.md) — this doc, committed.
- `sdl3-port` branch created from `master`; no `master` changes.

---

## Phase 1 — Build system portability ✅

**Stated goal**: configures on macOS/Linux.
**Actual outcome**: configures AND compiles AND links 100% on macOS,
producing a runnable (no-op) `JA2_ENGLISH` executable. Took ~50 commits
because of the extensive Win32 surface across `sgp/`, the multiple
inline-asm blocks, the Multiplayer/RakNet situation, and AppleClang's
strictness vs MSVC.

What landed:

- Build system: pre-built `.lib` files gated `if(WIN32)`. `wine/`
  subdir excluded from non-Windows. Resource compiler (`.rc`)
  excluded.
- Type portability: `sgp/types.h` uses `<cstdint>` instead of MSVC
  `__int64`. Profiler ditto.
- Vendored libs: bfVFS, libpng, zlib teach themselves macOS.
- The whole gating/stub layer described above (msvc_compat.h + ~50
  source files).

Build verification on macOS:

```
$ cmake -S . -B build -DLanguages=ENGLISH -DApplications=JA2
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
$ cmake --build build -j 4
[100%] Built target JA2_ENGLISH
$ ./build/JA2_ENGLISH
JA2 SDL3 port: non-Windows entry point not yet implemented.
This stub exists so the build links; Phase 3 wires SDL3 in.
```

Exit criteria met. Phase 2 begins.

---

## Phase 2 — Portable I/O, time, memory, debug

Strip Win32 dependencies out of the lowest layers of SGP so higher
layers can be ported without dragging Windows in transitively. Replace
compat-stub no-ops with real implementations.

**Concrete files to port:**

1. [sgp/FileMan.cpp](../sgp/FileMan.cpp) — replace `CreateFile` /
   `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` / `SetFilePointer` / `GetFileSize` /
   `WIN32_FIND_DATA` enumeration with `std::ifstream` /
   `std::ofstream` / `std::filesystem`. Add case-insensitive path
   resolution for asset directories (Stracciatella's logic is a good
   reference).
2. [sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp](../sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp) — port the
   SLF archive reader. Endianness audit on the SLF header (it's
   little-endian on disk; should already work on LE platforms, but
   confirm).
3. [Utils/Timer Control.cpp](../Utils/Timer%20Control.cpp) — rebuild
   the clock + notify threads on `std::thread` + `std::chrono` +
   `std::mutex` + `std::condition_variable`. Replace `timeSetEvent`
   periodic callback with a scheduler thread. This is the most
   complex Phase 2 task — JA2 has subtle timing assumptions.
4. [sgp/MemMan.cpp](../sgp/MemMan.cpp) — drop the Win32 heap
   debug-tracking branch entirely. The `MemAlloc`/`MemFree` macros
   already collapse to `malloc`/`free` on non-MSVC.
5. [sgp/DEBUG.cpp](../sgp/DEBUG.cpp), [sgp/debug_win_util.cpp](../sgp/debug_win_util.cpp) — portable logging (`sgp_logger` already
   handles most of it). The stack-trace helpers in
   `debug_win_util.cpp` should be gated `_WIN32`; non-Windows can use
   `<stacktrace>` (C++23, not universally available yet) or libunwind.
6. [sgp/timer.cpp](../sgp/timer.cpp) — replace the `SetTimer`-driven
   game clock with a `std::chrono`-driven equivalent. Tiny file.
7. Delete `wine/`. (The non-Win32 builds already exclude it.)
8. Remove the now-redundant Win32 file I/O stubs from msvc_compat.h.

**Exit criterion**: the non-video, non-input, non-audio parts of SGP
do useful work on non-Windows. File I/O succeeds, the clock advances,
SLF archives load.

---

## Phase 3 — SDL3 window, event loop, and message plumbing

Bring SDL3 in. This is the architectural shift the whole branch is
named after.

**Build system:**

- Add SDL3 dependency. Recommend `FetchContent` against the
  SDL3 release tag, falling back to `find_package(SDL3 CONFIG)` if
  the user has a system SDL3 installed:

  ```cmake
  find_package(SDL3 QUIET CONFIG)
  if(NOT TARGET SDL3::SDL3)
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(SDL3
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
      GIT_TAG release-3.2.x
      GIT_SHALLOW TRUE)
    set(SDL_SHARED ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    set(SDL_STATIC OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    set(SDL_TEST_LIBRARY OFF CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(SDL3)
  endif()
  target_link_libraries(${exe} PRIVATE SDL3::SDL3)
  ```

- The executable target gains `SDL_main_handler` linkage (Windows)
  or just `SDL3::SDL3` (others).

**Source changes:**

1. Replace the non-Windows stub `main()` in [sgp/sgp.cpp](../sgp/sgp.cpp)
   with a real SDL3 entry: `SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)`,
   `SDL_CreateWindow`, central `SDL_PollEvent` loop that fans into
   the existing `QueueEvent` path (input.cpp) and calls `GameLoop`.
   Keep Windows behavior unchanged for now (still uses WinMain
   path) — landing both paths concurrently de-risks rollback.
2. Replace `MessageBoxW` / `MessageBox` call sites with
   `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox`. ~20-30 sites; mostly in
   FatalError paths.
3. Replace `SetCursor` / `ShowCursor` with
   `SDL_HideCursor` / `SDL_ShowCursor` / `SDL_SetCursor`.
4. Introduce a `Ja2GetWindow()` accessor that returns `SDL_Window*`
   on non-Windows and `HWND` on Windows (or unify on `SDL_Window*`
   and let DirectDraw take it via `SDL_GetWindowProperty`).
5. Replace cnc-ddraw detection logic (the `bCncDdraw` path in
   sgp.cpp) with `SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver()` checks if needed.
6. Honour `iScreenMode` via `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN` /
   `SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE` etc.

**Exit criterion**: window opens on all three OSes; mouse and
keyboard events route into the event queue; game still renders via
DirectDraw on Windows; game runs to main menu (rendering blank but
not crashing) on macOS.

## Phase 4 — SDL3 input

Replace DirectInput / Win32 keyboard & mouse messages with SDL events.

**Source changes:**

1. [sgp/input.cpp](../sgp/input.cpp) — `KeyboardHandler` /
   `MouseHandler` Win32 hook procs replaced with an
   `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN` / `SDL_EVENT_KEY_UP` /
   `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_*` dispatch driven by Phase 3's `SDL_PollEvent`
   loop.
2. [Utils/KeyMap.cpp](../Utils/KeyMap.cpp) — rebuild the keycode
   translation. **The numeric VK_* values must be preserved** for
   savegame compatibility (they're persisted in hotkey config). Build
   a translation table from `SDL_Scancode` to the existing VK_*
   values.
3. Mouse handling: ScreenToClient-style coordinate conversions
   become `SDL_GetMouseState` calls (which already return window-
   coordinate). Drop the `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` shim once
   SDL is authoritative.
4. `SDL_StartTextInput` / `SDL_StopTextInput` around the dialogs
   that take typed names (use `gpCurrentStringDescriptor` as the
   gate signal).
5. Clipboard: `SDL_GetClipboardText` / `SDL_SetClipboardText` in
   [Utils/Text Input.cpp](../Utils/Text%20Input.cpp).
6. Cursor clipping: SDL3 has `SDL_SetWindowMouseRect`. Replace
   `RestrictMouseCursor` / `ClipCursor`-using sites.
7. Delete the `HHOOK ghKeyboardHook` / `ghMouseHook` globals and
   any other Win32-only input plumbing.

**Exit criterion**: keyboard, mouse, and clipboard fully functional
on all three platforms. Game playable through menus.

## Phase 5 — SDL3 video, transitional RGB565

Replace DirectDraw with SDL3 rendering while keeping the existing
RGB565 internal pipeline. **This is the milestone where macOS and
Linux first see pixels.**

**Source changes:**

1. Rewrite [sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp) — at this scale, easier
   to rewrite than to port. Keep the SGP public API
   (`InvalidateRegion` / `LockBackBuffer` / `RefreshScreen` etc.)
   stable. Implementation:
   - Primary surface → `SDL_Texture(SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB565,
     SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING)` at game's logical resolution.
   - Backbuffer / framebuffer / mouse buffer → plain heap `UINT16*`
     (no DD surface).
   - `Flip` / `BltFast` → `SDL_UpdateTexture` + `SDL_RenderTexture`
     + `SDL_RenderPresent`.
2. Same treatment for [sgp/vsurface.cpp](../sgp/vsurface.cpp). The
   200+ blitters in [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp)
   are NOT touched in this phase — they still write RGB565 to CPU-
   side buffers; SDL hands those buffers to the GPU.
3. Delete [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.cpp](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.cpp),
   [sgp/DirectX Common.cpp](../sgp/DirectX%20Common.cpp),
   [sgp/ddraw.h](../sgp/ddraw.h), `ddraw.lib`.
4. Delete cnc-ddraw detection (the `bCncDdraw` path).
5. Delete the `ADDTEXT_16BPP_REQUIRED` error path
   ([sgp/video.cpp:2780](../sgp/video.cpp#L2780)).
6. The inline-asm RGB565 alpha blender at
   [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp:19-60](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp#L19-L60)
   needs replacement with portable C — keep RGB565 math, just stop
   using `__asm`. This is a stop-gap; Phase 6 retires it entirely.

**Exit criterion**: game boots into main menu on all three platforms
and renders correctly via the existing RGB565 pipeline. End-to-end
at least one battle playable.

---

## Phase 6 — RGBA8888 pipeline conversion

Now that everything routes through SDL, swap the internal pixel
format.

1. Change `PIXEL_DEPTH` in [Ja2/local.h](../Ja2/local.h) from 16 to 32.
2. Wide-rename `UINT16* pBuffer` → `UINT32* pBuffer` across every
   blitter and caller. Adjust pitch math (bytes-per-pixel doubles).
3. Regenerate the 8bpp→32bpp palette LUTs in
   [sgp/himage.cpp](../sgp/himage.cpp). The shading, fade-to-black,
   fade-to-white, translucency, and night-vision tables in
   [sgp/shading.cpp](../sgp/shading.cpp) all need RGBA8888
   equivalents.
4. Rewrite every blitter in
   [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp) — there
   are dozens of variants (TransZ, TransZNB, TransZClip,
   TransZTranslucent, MonoShadow, Pixelate, …). Drop the inline asm.
5. Replace the inline-asm `blendWithAlpha` and every other RGB565
   bit-math site with portable C (consider SDL_SIMD intrinsics).
6. Update SDL texture format to `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ARGB8888` or
   matching endianness.
7. Update saveable surfaces / screenshot writers
   ([sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp) TGA path).
8. Z-buffer stays `UINT16` (it's a depth value, not a color).

**Risk**: this is the phase where game-rendering regressions hide.
Plan golden-image regression testing — render a known scene under
Phase 5 (tag the commit) vs Phase 6, diff the buffers.

**Exit criterion**: game is visually identical (or better) to Phase 5
on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 7 — Audio: SFX & music

Replace FMOD / Miles Sound System.

- Pick: SDL3_mixer vs SoLoud vs miniaudio. Bias toward SDL3_mixer
  (already on SDL3). Audit feature coverage first — positional audio?
  arbitrary channel counts? low-latency triggering?
- Replace [sgp/soundman.cpp](../sgp/soundman.cpp) backend; keep public
  API stable.
- Audit MSS-isms in [sgp/Mss.h](../sgp/Mss.h) / `Mss-old.h` — many
  call signatures are MSS-shaped (`HSAMPLE`/`HSTREAM` handles);
  these become opaque pointers backed by the new engine.
- Music streaming (Ogg/MP3) — ensure file-format support matches
  what the game ships.
- Delete `fmodvc.lib` linkage.

**Exit criterion**: SFX and music on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 8 — Cinematics

- Replace Smacker decoding with [libsmacker](https://libsmacker.sourceforge.net/)
  (open-source, MIT-licensed, decodes original Smacker format).
- Bink: drop, or convert assets to Smacker/WebM, or use FFmpeg if
  licensing allows. Decision deferred until we audit which assets
  are which.
- Render decoded video frames into an `SDL_Texture` and present.
- Delete `binkw32.lib` / `SMACKW32.LIB` linkage.

**Exit criterion**: cinematics play (or are gracefully skipped) on
all three platforms.

---

## Phase 9 — Fonts & GDI cleanup

- Replace [sgp/WinFont.cpp](../sgp/WinFont.cpp) with stb_truetype
  (single-header, public domain).
- Most of the game uses pre-rendered bitmap fonts shipped in the
  asset bundle, so this code path is only used in a few places
  (mod-added text, debug overlays).

**Exit criterion**: all text renders on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 10 — Platform packaging & CI

- macOS: `.app` bundle, code-signing config (unsigned for now),
  resource path resolution via `SDL_GetBasePath`.
- Linux: AppImage (initially).
- Windows: keep existing installer flow; produce a zip artifact too.
- CI matrix: build all three on every PR. At minimum "configures &
  compiles". Ideally a headless boot smoke test.

---

## Open questions / decisions still pending

1. **Lua 5.1 vs Lua 5.4** — the master-branch TODO mentions building
   Lua from source. JA2 mods may depend on 5.1 semantics. Default:
   stay on 5.1.x source build, defer any version bump.
2. **Multiplayer long-term** — RakNet 4 port, SDL3_net swap, or just
   leave it Windows-only forever? Question for the maintainers.
3. **Editor builds** — JA2MAPEDITOR / JA2UBMAPEDITOR targets must
   keep building. Should they share the SDL3 surface or stay legacy?
4. **Threading** — once Phase 2 ports Timer Control to std::thread,
   audit other `CreateThread` / `_beginthread` usage. Saw a few in
   sgp.cpp's WindowProcedure.
5. **Save format compatibility** — must not change. Worth a fuzz
   round-trip test before merging Phase 6.

## Reference: upstream prior art

- [ja2-stracciatella](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella) —
  ported the *original* JA2 to SDL2 over ~10 years. Their video,
  input, audio, and filesystem layers are useful reference but can't
  be copied wholesale — they diverged from the 1.13 lineage long ago
  and 1.13's feature surface is dramatically larger. License is
  compatible (SFI-1.0 / GPL-style); attribution required if we lift
  specific code.
- [facebookarchive/RakNet](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RakNet)
  — RakNet 4.081, the only public RakNet source. JA2 uses 3.401
  which has incompatible API; see Multiplayer section.
- [libsdl-org/SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) — SDL3, latest
  release.
- [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) — stb_truetype for
  Phase 9.
- [libsmacker](https://libsmacker.sourceforge.net/) — Phase 8 Smacker
  replacement.

## Commit log shape

Roughly 50 commits on `sdl3-port` past `master` at the close of
Phase 1. Each commit is scoped to a small, reviewable change with a
concrete message. The first commits (Phase 0/1 baseline) and the
final Phase 1 close are easy to identify in the log. The middle is a
long sequence of clang-strictness fixes and Win32-gating commits;
they could be squashed before merging upstream if desired, but the
granularity is handy for bisecting regressions.
