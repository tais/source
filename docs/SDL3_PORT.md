# SDL3 Port Plan

Tracking doc for migrating JA2 1.13 off Win32 / DirectDraw / FMOD / Smacker
onto SDL3 + cross-platform equivalents, with a 32-bit RGBA8888 internal
rendering pipeline.

This lives on the `sdl3-port` branch. `master` is left untouched.

**End state — important**: SDL3 fully replaces the Win32 + DirectDraw +
FMOD + GDI stack **on every platform**, including Windows. There is no
permanent two-path build. The `#ifdef _WIN32` gates that appeared all
over `sgp/` during Phase 1 are **transitional scaffolding** — they
exist only because the Win32 implementations are still the only ones
that work today. Each phase deletes a chunk of Win32 code AND its
`_WIN32` gates on its way out, replacing them with the portable SDL3
implementation. By Phase 10 there should be zero `_WIN32` gates left
in the codebase (other than packaging differences in CMake), and the
pre-built `.lib` blobs at the repo root are deleted.

## Status at a glance

| Phase | Description | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Branch + plan doc | ✅ Done |
| 1 | Build system portability — configures, compiles, and links on macOS | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Portable file I/O / time / memory / debug | Partial via compat shims; real porting pending |
| 3 | SDL3 window + event loop, drop WinMain | 🟡 Started — SDL3 wired into CMake, minimal window+event-loop main() on non-Windows. JA2 game loop not yet dispatched; SDL event translation lives in main() but routes to a local debug stub instead of the real `QueueEvent`. |
| 4 | SDL3 input, drop DirectInput / Win32 hooks | Not started |
| 5 | SDL3 video (RGB565 transitional), retire DirectDraw | 🟡 Started — RGB565 SDL_Texture upload path working with a test pattern in sgp.cpp's main(). Needs the JA2 framebuffer wired in. |
| 6 | RGBA8888 pipeline, rewrite blitters, kill inline asm | Not started |
| 7 | Audio — SDL3_mixer / SoLoud, drop FMOD | Not started |
| 8 | Cinematics — libsmacker, decide on Bink | Not started |
| 9 | Fonts — stb_truetype, drop GDI | Not started |
| 10 | Platform packaging + CI | Not started |
| ∞ | Multiplayer — port to RakNet 4 or netlib swap | Deferred indefinitely |

As of Phase 1 closing, the build hits `[100%] Built target JA2_ENGLISH`
on macOS. The resulting binary prints a "not yet implemented" notice
and exits — nothing renders, nothing accepts input, nothing plays
audio. **Every Win32-gated block in the codebase corresponds to a
named phase below**; that's the work plan.

## Goals

- Native builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux (all first-class), all
  using the same SDL3-backed implementation. No Windows-only legacy
  path past Phase 10.
- No DirectX, no Win32 GUI/audio APIs, no Wine workarounds, no cnc-ddraw
  shim. The `wine/` subdirectory goes away. **On Windows** the
  message pump, window class, DirectDraw rendering, DirectSound, GDI
  fonts, Win32 file I/O, and Win32 input hooks all get deleted as
  their phase swaps them for SDL3.
- Internal rendering pipeline is RGBA8888 (32-bit). RGB565 surfaces,
  16-bit palette LUTs, and the inline-asm RGB565 alpha blender are
  retired.
- Audio (SFX, music, Smacker cinematics) replaced with portable
  libraries in this same effort.
- Build system is CMake-only and fetches its dependencies (no
  pre-built `.lib` blobs checked into the repo).

## Non-goals (for this branch)

- Refactoring game logic beyond what the API changes force.
- Touching the modding/INI/Lua interfaces.
- Rewriting the editor as a separate concern — it must keep building
  but is not the focus.
- Networking (Multiplayer) beyond keeping it linking; SDL_net swap is
  out of scope.

## Approach

Land the work in independent, reviewable phases. Each phase should
leave the branch in a buildable state on at least Windows, and the
later phases should leave it buildable on all three targets. Each
phase below is roughly a PR-sized chunk and will be broken into
several commits.

The strategy is **strangler-fig**: introduce the SDL3 surface
underneath the existing SGP API, then swap one subsystem at a time,
deleting the Win32 implementation as each subsystem is migrated. The
SGP public API (what the rest of the game calls) stays mostly stable;
the implementation behind it is what changes.

---

## How Phase 1 was actually closed

Phase 1's exit criterion turned out to be more invasive than the
original plan anticipated. Rather than write SDL3 code in this phase,
we landed an extensive **gating + compat-stub layer** so the existing
Win32/DirectDraw/FMOD code is preserved verbatim under `#ifdef _WIN32`
and non-Windows builds get either:

- Inline stubs (for typedefs and small helpers) defined in
  [sgp/msvc_compat.h](../sgp/msvc_compat.h), or
- No-op function definitions (for whole subsystems like Multiplayer).

This means **on Windows nothing changed at runtime**. On non-Windows
the build compiles and links but most subsystems are non-functional
until their respective phase replaces the gated blocks with real
SDL3-backed implementations.

### The compat header — `sgp/msvc_compat.h`

Single biggest piece of new code. Active only on non-Windows. Provides:

- **Win32 unsized typedefs**: `BOOL`, `UINT`, `INT`, `ULONG`, `LONG`,
  `WORD`, `USHORT`, `DWORD`, `BYTE`, `CHAR`, `WCHAR`, `UCHAR`,
  `LONGLONG`, `ULONGLONG`, `HANDLE`, `LPVOID`, `LPSTR`, `LPCSTR`,
  `LPWSTR`, `LPCWSTR`, `LPDWORD`, `VOID`.
- **Win32 structs**: `FILETIME`, `RECT`, `RGBQUAD`, `SYSTEMTIME`,
  `WIN32_FIND_DATA`, `LARGE_INTEGER` (union with `QuadPart`),
  `CRITICAL_SECTION`, `MEMORYSTATUS`, `TIMECAPS`.
- **`MAX_PATH`** as `PATH_MAX`.
- **Min/max**: `__min`, `__max`, `min`, `max` macros (POSIX has them
  but lowercase `min`/`max` conflict with `std::min`/`std::max`; we
  pick the ternary-macro form for compat with Windows behavior).
- **String/array**: `_countof`, `_stricmp`/`_strnicmp`/`_wcsicmp`
  mapped to `strcasecmp`/`strncasecmp`/`wcscasecmp`, `_strupr` /
  `_strlwr` / `_wcsupr` / `_wcslwr` written as ASCII-range loops,
  `_itow` / `_ltow` hand-rolled, `_wtoi` as `wcstol`, `wcstok_2arg`
  shim mapping MSVC's 2-arg form onto POSIX's 3-arg form, `sprintf_s`
  as `snprintf`, `MAXUINT8/16/32` macros.
- **swprintf macro** routing through a `sgp_compat::arrsize` template
  that pulls the array extent at compile time. Pointer-buffer call
  sites that legitimately need explicit size use **`sgp_swprintf`** —
  defined at the bottom of the file, available cross-platform.
- **`vswprintf` template overload** for the same array-extent trick.
- **Win32 string conversion stubs**: `MultiByteToWideChar` /
  `WideCharToMultiByte` return 0 (failure). `CP_ACP` / `CP_UTF8`
  macros. *Phase 5–7 should replace these with `std::codecvt` or
  `iconv`.*
- **Time stubs**: `GetTickCount` via `std::chrono::steady_clock`,
  `Sleep` via `std::this_thread::sleep_for`, `timeBeginPeriod` /
  `timeEndPeriod` / `timeSetEvent` / `timeKillEvent` as no-ops,
  `QueryPerformanceFrequency` / `QueryPerformanceCounter` via
  `std::chrono::steady_clock`, `GetCurrentThreadId` returns 1.
- **Thread/event stubs (BIG WARNING)**: `CreateThread` returns NULL —
  the JA2 clock thread and notify thread don't actually run on
  non-Windows. `CreateEvent` / `SetEvent` / `ResetEvent` /
  `WaitForSingleObject` / `WaitForMultipleObjects[Ex]` /
  `CloseHandle` are no-ops returning `WAIT_TIMEOUT`. Critical-section
  ops are no-ops on a tiny struct.
- **File I/O stubs (BIG WARNING)**: `CreateFile` returns
  `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` / `SetFilePointer`
  / `GetFileSize` / `FormatMessage` are no-ops. **SLF library reading
  will not work** until Phase 2 ports `LibraryDataBase.cpp` to use
  `std::ifstream`.
- **Heap stubs**: `GetProcessHeap` returns sentinel, `HeapAlloc` /
  `HeapFree` route through `malloc`/`free`, `VirtualAlloc` /
  `VirtualFree` / `VirtualLock` / `VirtualUnlock` route through
  `malloc`/`free` (lock semantics dropped).
- **Error codes**: `ERROR_SUCCESS`, `ERROR_NOT_READY`,
  `ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER`. `GetLastError` returns 0.
- **`OutputDebugString[A|W]`** emit to `stderr`.
- **`__debugbreak`** as `__builtin_trap`.
- **`ZeroMemory`** as `memset(_, 0, _)`.
- **`_abs64`** as `llabs`.
- **`GetPrivateProfileString[A]`** stub that writes the supplied
  default. *Phase 2 should remove this when the legacy INI helpers
  are dropped.*
- **`OPEN_EXISTING` / `GENERIC_READ` etc.**: full set of Win32 file
  flag constants for compile-time use.

When any of these gets a real cross-platform implementation in its
phase, the compat shim should be deleted to avoid drift.

### Gated subsystems

The big picture: every Win32-specific subsystem now compiles to an
empty translation unit (or stub) on non-Windows. Listed by which phase
will revive them:

#### Phase 2 — file I/O / time / memory

- [sgp/FileMan.cpp](../sgp/FileMan.cpp): direct `<io.h>` /
  `<direct.h>` / `<windows.h>` gated. Uses `WIN32_FIND_DATA`,
  `CreateFile`, `ReadFile`, `SetFilePointer`, etc. — currently routes
  through the compat stubs which fail. **Phase 2 rewrites on
  `std::filesystem` / `<cstdio>`** with case-insensitive resolution
  for asset paths (mirror Stracciatella's known-good implementation).
- [sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp](../sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp): SLF archive
  reader. Same story — uses Win32 file APIs via the compat stubs.
  Phase 2 ports to portable streams. The `_splitpath` site has a
  basename-by-last-slash fallback at line ~984.
- [sgp/MemMan.cpp](../sgp/MemMan.cpp): `<windows.h>` gated. The
  `_DEBUG && _MSC_VER` heap-tracking branch falls through to plain
  malloc on non-MSVC.
- [sgp/timer.cpp](../sgp/timer.cpp): `Clock` callback and
  `SetTimer` / `KillTimer` gated. Non-Windows reads `GetTickCount`
  (compat shim) directly. Phase 2 should provide a proper monotonic
  timer.
- [Utils/Timer Control.cpp](../Utils/Timer%20Control.cpp): the
  JA2 clock thread + notify thread machinery uses Win32 events,
  mutexes, and `timeSetEvent` callbacks. Currently those are all
  no-op compat stubs — **the clock thread doesn't tick on non-Windows**,
  so anything counting on `guiBaseJA2Clock` advancing is broken.
  Phase 2 rebuilds on `std::thread` + `std::chrono` + `std::mutex` +
  `std::condition_variable`. SEH `__try`/`__except`/`__finally`
  blocks gated on `_MSC_VER`.
- [sgp/Random.cpp](../sgp/Random.cpp): `<windows.h>` and the
  `GetCursorPos` cursor-position seed contribution are gated.
- [sgp/DEBUG.cpp](../sgp/DEBUG.cpp): the assertion message pump that
  pumps `PeekMessage` is gated; non-Windows path just calls
  `GameLoop` until `gfProgramIsRunning` flips. SEH blocks gated on
  `_MSC_VER`. The `<crtdbg.h>` include is gated on `_MSC_VER`.

#### Phase 3 — window, event loop, message plumbing

- [sgp/sgp.cpp](../sgp/sgp.cpp): the **entire 1410-line file** is
  gated behind `_WIN32`. `WinMain`, `WindowProcedure`, the window
  class registration, the cnc-ddraw detection (`bCncDdraw`), the
  `iScreenMode` / windowed/fullscreen plumbing, the dll-override-by-
  Wine helper — all of it. The non-Windows replacement is a stub
  `main()` at the bottom of the file. **Phase 3 writes a portable
  `SDL_main` that calls `SDL_CreateWindow`, runs `SDL_PollEvent`
  fanning into JA2's event queue, and dispatches into the game loop.**
- [wine/](../wine/): the registry-poking Wine DLL override helper.
  Already excluded from non-Windows builds by the top-level
  CMakeLists `if(WIN32)`. Phase 3 deletes the directory once SDL3
  replaces DirectDraw entirely.
- [sgp/video.h](../sgp/video.h): `HWND ghWindow` and the
  `LPDIRECTDRAW2 GetDirectDraw2Object()`-style getters are behind
  `_WIN32`. Phase 3 introduces a portable accessor for the window
  handle (likely `SDL_Window*` directly, or an opaque pointer).
- `MessageBox` / `ShowWindow` / `SetCursor` call sites across the
  codebase. Phase 3 swaps to `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox` /
  `SDL_HideCursor` / `SDL_SetCursor`.

#### Phase 4 — input

- [sgp/input.cpp](../sgp/input.cpp): `KeyboardHandler` /
  `MouseHandler` Win32 hook procedures (`LRESULT CALLBACK`),
  `SetWindowsHookEx` / `UnhookWindowsHookEx`, `CallNextHookEx`,
  `MOUSEHOOKSTRUCT` consumer, `WM_*` switch — all gated `_WIN32`.
  `HHOOK` globals gated too. `RestrictMouseCursor` / `FreeMouseCursor`
  / `RestoreCursorClipRect` / `GetRestrictedClipCursor` /
  `SimulateMouseMovement` cursor-clipping gated. `DequeueAllKeyBoardEvents`
  `PeekMessage` pump gated. SEH `__try`/`__except`/`__finally` blocks
  gated on `_MSC_VER`. `GetCursorPos` mouse-poll sites all replaced
  with `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` fallback on non-Windows.
- [Utils/KeyMap.cpp](../Utils/KeyMap.cpp): the entire VK_* virtual-
  key-code translation table (160 constants) is gated `_WIN32`.
  **Phase 4 must rebuild this on `SDL_Scancode` while preserving the
  numeric VK_* values for save-game compatibility** (those values are
  persisted in savegames and config files).
- [Utils/Text Input.cpp](../Utils/Text%20Input.cpp): `PasteClipboardText`
  / `CopyToClipboard` (Win32 clipboard) gated; non-Windows stubs
  return 0 / no-op. Phase 4 wires them to `SDL_GetClipboardText` /
  `SDL_SetClipboardText`.
- 12+ `GetCursorPos` / `ScreenToClient` sites in screen-handler
  files (Ja2/FeaturesScreen, Ja2/gameloop, Laptop/BriefingRoom*,
  Laptop/laptop, Laptop/personnel, Laptop/MPChatScreen,
  Strategic/Map Screen Interface Bottom, Tactical/Turn Based Input,
  TileEngine/Tactical Placement GUI, Ja2/HelpScreen) all gated
  `_WIN32` with `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` fallback.

#### Phase 5 — video (DirectDraw → SDL3, keep RGB565 internally first)

- [sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp): entire 3317-line file gated
  `_WIN32`. The whole DirectDraw video subsystem.
- [sgp/vsurface.cpp](../sgp/vsurface.cpp): entire 2803-line file
  gated `_WIN32`. DirectDraw surface manager.
- [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.cpp](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.cpp) +
  [sgp/DirectX Common.cpp](../sgp/DirectX%20Common.cpp): wholly
  gated `_WIN32`.
- [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.h](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.h): wholly gated
  `_WIN32` so the `<ddraw.h>` pull doesn't reach non-Windows.
- [sgp/ddraw.h](../sgp/ddraw.h), `ddraw.lib`, `fmodvc.lib`,
  `binkw32.lib`, `SMACKW32.LIB`, `mss32.lib` — only linked on
  Windows via the top-level CMakeLists `if(WIN32)`. Deleted in
  Phase 5 once SDL3 owns the surface stack.
- Phase 5 milestone: **game boots into main menu on macOS/Linux**,
  presenting the existing RGB565 framebuffer via `SDL_Texture` with
  `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB565`. End-to-end at least one battle playable.

#### Phase 6 — RGBA8888 pipeline

- [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp): all 77
  inline-asm blocks gated `_WIN32`. **Game renders blank on non-Windows
  until Phase 6 rewrites these as portable C/SIMD** against a 32-bit
  RGBA framebuffer.
- [TileEngine/renderworld.cpp](../TileEngine/renderworld.cpp): 10
  more inline-asm blocks (sprite blitters with Z-buffer handling).
- [sgp/shading.cpp](../sgp/shading.cpp): single inline-asm block.
- [Ja2/local.h](../Ja2/local.h): `PIXEL_DEPTH 16` constant. Phase 6
  changes to 32 and propagates.
- The 8bpp→16bpp palette LUTs, shading tables, translucency tables,
  fade tables — all need RGBA8888 regenerations.
- `GetRGBDistribution()` in video.cpp goes away (only relevant for
  RGB565 mask detection).

#### Phase 7 — audio

- [Utils/dsutil.cpp](../Utils/dsutil.cpp): entire DirectSound utility
  gated `_WIN32`. Phase 7 replaces with SDL3_mixer or SoLoud /
  miniaudio glue.
- [sgp/soundman.cpp](../sgp/soundman.cpp): the JA2 sound API. Uses
  FMOD throughout. Phase 7 keeps the public API stable but swaps the
  backend.
- `fmodvc.lib` / `mss32.lib` linkage already conditional on `WIN32`.
- [sgp/Mss.h](../sgp/Mss.h) and `Mss-old.h`: Miles Sound System
  headers. Phase 7 deletes once FMOD/MSS callers are migrated.

#### Phase 8 — cinematics

- [Utils/Cinematics.h](../Utils/Cinematics.h) / `.cpp` (Smacker):
  entirely gated `_WIN32`. Phase 8 replaces with libsmacker (MIT,
  open-source decoder for original Smacker format).
- [Utils/Cinematics Bink.h](../Utils/Cinematics%20Bink.h) / `.cpp`
  (Bink): entirely gated `_WIN32`. Phase 8 must decide between
  asset-conversion (Smacker/WebM), FFmpeg-with-license, or just
  skipping Bink cutscenes on non-Windows.
- [Ja2/Intro.cpp](../Ja2/Intro.cpp): the intro-screen video player —
  entire body gated `_WIN32`. Not currently dispatched to from gameplay
  (the `MAP_EXIT_TO_INTRO_SCREEN` switch is commented out everywhere),
  so the gate is safe.
- `binkw32.lib` / `SMACKW32.LIB` linkage already conditional on `WIN32`.

#### Phase 9 — fonts

- [sgp/WinFont.cpp](../sgp/WinFont.cpp): entire GDI-backed TrueType
  font rasterizer gated `_WIN32`. Phase 9 replaces with `stb_truetype`
  (single-header, public domain).
- [sgp/WinFont.h](../sgp/WinFont.h): non-Windows branch declares
  inline no-op stubs for `InitWinFonts`, `CreateWinFont`,
  `SetWinFontForeColor`, `PrintWinFont`, `GetWinFontHeight`, etc.
  Phase 9 replaces these with the stb_truetype implementations.
- [Utils/Font Control.cpp](../Utils/Font%20Control.cpp): two
  `InitWinFonts` / `ShutdownWinFonts` call sites gated `_WIN32`.

#### Phase 10 — packaging + CI

- Top-level [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt): `add_executable(... WIN32 ...)`
  could grow `MACOSX_BUNDLE` and Linux variants. Pre-built `.lib`
  files (`binkw32.lib`, `lua51.lib`, `SMACKW32.LIB`,
  `libexpatMT.lib`) already gated `if(WIN32)`. Pulling Lua, Expat,
  Bink (when replaced), Smacker (when replaced) from source on every
  platform is Phase 10 cleanup.
- CI matrix for Windows / macOS / Linux. App bundle / AppImage / zip
  packaging. None of this exists yet.

### Deferred indefinitely — Multiplayer

- JA2 uses **RakNet 3.401** as a Win32 prebuilt `.lib`
  (`Multiplayer/raknet/RakNetLibStatic.lib`, 5.3 MB). The matching
  3.x source isn't on any public mirror — Jenkins Software's SVN
  died with the company. Facebook open-sourced only 4.x
  ([facebookarchive/RakNet](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RakNet))
  and 4.x has substantial API breaks from 3.x (`RakNetworkFactory`
  removed, `AutoRPC` removed, `RPC()` gone, `BitStream` semantics
  changed, types namespaced).
- [Multiplayer/mp_stubs.cpp](../Multiplayer/mp_stubs.cpp) provides
  no-op definitions for every external symbol JA2 references from
  the network wrapper (~50 globals like `is_networked` /
  `is_connected`, ~70 functions like `send_path` / `send_fire` /
  `NetworkAutoStart`, plus `CTransferRules`). The `Multiplayer`
  CMake target builds `mp_stubs.cpp` on non-Windows; on Windows it
  builds the three wrapper files and links RakNet as before.
- Reviving multiplayer on non-Windows = vendoring RakNet 4 + porting
  JA2's wrapper code (~327 RakNet API references) per the upstream
  `3.x_to_4.x_upgrade.txt`, **or** retargeting to a different netlib
  (SDL3_net, enet, asio). Multi-day project either way.

### Other clang-strictness fixes landed in Phase 1

MSVC-tolerated patterns clang rejects, fixed as we hit them:

- **MSVC `__int64`** → `int64_t`/`uint64_t` from `<cstdint>`.
- **Stray `typename`** in template argument lists (popup_callback.h,
  Singleton.h, several other places).
- **`POPUP_OPTION::POPUP_OPTION(void)`** self-qualification on inline
  declarations.
- **`static`/non-static mismatch**: forward decls without `static`
  but defs with `static` (DisplayCover.cpp, Music Control.cpp,
  soundman.cpp, lua_env.cpp, lua_tactical.cpp).
- **Out-of-line template-member redeclarations** without body
  (BaseTable.h, DropDown.h, MilitiaWebsite.cpp).
- **Explicit template specialization after implicit instantiation**:
  forward-declared specializations at top of file (MilitiaWebsite.cpp).
- **Narrowing in brace initializers**: per-entry casts to the target
  type (Isometric Utils.cpp, Soldier Control.cpp), or rewrite as
  assignments (AimSort.cpp, BobbyR.cpp).
- **Pointer-to-smaller-int casts** on 64-bit: intermediate
  `(uintptr_t)` cast acknowledges the truncation (Vehicles.cpp,
  Strategic Movement.cpp, Soldier Control.cpp, soundman.cpp,
  FileMan.cpp).
- **Pointer-to-bool / pointer-to-zero comparisons**: rewritten with
  `!= NULL` (XML_ComboMergeInfo.cpp, XML_ItemAdjustments.cpp). The
  `SGP_THROW_IFFALSE` macro switched from `== false` to `!(cond)`.
- **String-literal-macro concatenation** needs a space between
  literal and identifier in C++11 (Button System.cpp).
- **MSVC `swprintf(buf, fmt, ...)` 2-arg signature** vs POSIX 3-arg:
  resolved by the `swprintf` macro + template helper. ~3000 call
  sites covered automatically; ~120 pointer-buffer sites converted
  to explicit `sgp_swprintf(buf, count, ...)`.
- **`SoldierID` ambiguous conversion**: added `long` /
  `unsigned long` constructors so `lua_Integer` (which is `long` on
  clang/libc++) finds an unambiguous match.
- **`_array` reserved name + dependent-base access** in
  sgp_auto_memory.h: dropped extra `typename`, added `this->_array`.
- **`Exception::what()` exception spec mismatch**: added `throw()`
  to definition to match header.
- **VFS macOS support**: ext/VFS/include/vfs/Core/vfs_types.h
  switched `__linux__` branch to default-non-Windows so Apple
  picks up the `<stdint.h>` typedefs.
- **libpng macOS support**: ext/libpng/pngconf.h classic-MacOS
  `<fp.h>` branch gated on `!__APPLE__`.
- **zlib macOS support**: ext/zlib/zutil.h classic-MacOS `fdopen`
  stub gated on `!__APPLE__`; gzguts.h includes `<unistd.h>` on
  non-Windows.

---

## Phase 0 — Branch & baseline ✅

Done.

- [docs/SDL3_PORT.md](SDL3_PORT.md) — this doc, committed.
- `sdl3-port` branch created from `master`; no `master` changes.

---

## Phase 1 — Build system portability ✅

**Stated goal**: configures on macOS/Linux.
**Actual outcome**: configures AND compiles AND links 100% on macOS,
producing a runnable (no-op) `JA2_ENGLISH` executable. Took ~50 commits
because of the extensive Win32 surface across `sgp/`, the multiple
inline-asm blocks, the Multiplayer/RakNet situation, and AppleClang's
strictness vs MSVC.

What landed:

- Build system: pre-built `.lib` files gated `if(WIN32)`. `wine/`
  subdir excluded from non-Windows. Resource compiler (`.rc`)
  excluded.
- Type portability: `sgp/types.h` uses `<cstdint>` instead of MSVC
  `__int64`. Profiler ditto.
- Vendored libs: bfVFS, libpng, zlib teach themselves macOS.
- The whole gating/stub layer described above (msvc_compat.h + ~50
  source files).

Build verification on macOS:

```
$ cmake -S . -B build -DLanguages=ENGLISH -DApplications=JA2
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
$ cmake --build build -j 4
[100%] Built target JA2_ENGLISH
$ ./build/JA2_ENGLISH
JA2 SDL3 port: non-Windows entry point not yet implemented.
This stub exists so the build links; Phase 3 wires SDL3 in.
```

Exit criteria met. Phase 2 begins.

---

## Phase 2 — Portable I/O, time, memory, debug

Strip Win32 dependencies out of the lowest layers of SGP so higher
layers can be ported without dragging Windows in transitively. Replace
compat-stub no-ops with real implementations.

**Status update (2026-05-16):** the planned `FileMan.cpp` rewrite is
substantially smaller than expected. FileMan.cpp **does not call any
Win32 file API directly** — it routes everything through `vfs::*` /
`getVFS()`, and bfVFS (`ext/VFS/src/Core/vfs_os_functions.cpp`) already
has a complete POSIX branch (`scandir`, `getcwd`, `mkdir`, `remove`,
`chdir`). The only macOS-specific gap was `getExecutablePath` using
Linux's `readlink("/proc/self/exe")` — fixed by switching to
`_NSGetExecutablePath` from `<mach-o/dyld.h>` under `__APPLE__`. The
compat-layer `CreateFileA` / `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` / `HFILE` stubs
in msvc_compat.h are **not actually exercised** by FileMan; they exist
only so legacy unported translation units still compile.

**Concrete files to port:**

1. ~~[sgp/FileMan.cpp](../sgp/FileMan.cpp) — replace `CreateFile` /
   `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` / `SetFilePointer` / `GetFileSize` /
   `WIN32_FIND_DATA` enumeration with `std::ifstream` /
   `std::ofstream` / `std::filesystem`.~~ **Not needed** — already
   abstracted through bfVFS, which has working POSIX paths. macOS
   exec-path gap patched.
2. ~~[sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp](../sgp/LibraryDataBase.cpp) — port the
   SLF archive reader. Endianness audit on the SLF header.~~
   **Not needed.** bfVFS has its own SLF reader
   (`ext/VFS/src/Ext/slf/vfs_slf_library.cpp`, enabled by `VFS_WITH_SLF`)
   and that's what `InitVirtualFileSystem` actually mounts. The legacy
   `LibraryDataBase.cpp` is only kept alive by a single
   `ShutDownFileDatabase()` cleanup call which is a no-op against an
   uninitialised database. bfVFS's reader does no byte-swapping —
   correct for all current LE targets (x86_64, arm64).
3. ~~[Utils/Timer Control.cpp](../Utils/Timer%20Control.cpp) — rebuild
   the clock + notify threads on `std::thread` + `std::chrono` +
   `std::mutex` + `std::condition_variable`. Replace `timeSetEvent`
   periodic callback with a scheduler thread.~~ **Done.** Rewrite
   replaces every Win32 primitive (`timeSetEvent` / `CreateThread` /
   `CreateEvent` / `CRITICAL_SECTION` / `QueryPerformanceCounter` /
   `SEH __try`) with portable C++11. Single implementation for every
   platform — no `_WIN32` gate. Public API + globals unchanged.
4. ~~[sgp/MemMan.cpp](../sgp/MemMan.cpp) — drop the Win32 heap
   debug-tracking branch entirely.~~ **Done.** Removed
   `VirtualAlloc`/`VirtualLock` from `MemAllocLocked`/`MemFreeLocked`
   (collapses to `malloc`/`free`) and dropped the
   `MEMORYSTATUS`/`GlobalMemoryStatus` call in
   `MemGetFree`/`MemGetTotalSystem` (now returns 0; only used for
   diagnostic ScreenMsg). The MSVC `_DEBUG` leak-tracking branch is
   left in place — it only activates on MSVC debug builds and gives
   real value there. The corresponding stubs in `msvc_compat.h` were
   dropped along with the call sites.
5. ~~[sgp/DEBUG.cpp](../sgp/DEBUG.cpp), [sgp/debug_win_util.cpp](../sgp/debug_win_util.cpp) — portable logging (`sgp_logger` already
   handles most of it). The stack-trace helpers in
   `debug_win_util.cpp` should be gated `_WIN32`; non-Windows can use
   `<stacktrace>` (C++23, not universally available yet) or libunwind.~~
   **Done.** `debug_win_util.cpp` was already `_MSC_VER`-gated (compiles
   to an empty TU on clang/gcc). Added a portable `StackTrace::StackTrace`
   / `PrintBacktrace` / `OutputToStream` body in `debug_util.cpp` that
   uses `<execinfo.h>` (`backtrace` + `backtrace_symbols`, available on
   macOS and glibc Linux). `DEBUG.cpp`'s `<windows.h>` include + the
   inline Win32 message pump in `_FailMessage` were already
   `_WIN32`-gated; `OutputDebugString` routes to stderr via the compat
   layer.
6. ~~[sgp/timer.cpp](../sgp/timer.cpp) — replace the `SetTimer`-driven
   game clock with a `std::chrono`-driven equivalent. Tiny file.~~
   **Done.** Dropped the SetTimer/KillTimer dance; `GetClock()` now
   samples `std::chrono::steady_clock` directly.
7. ~~Delete `wine/`.~~ **Done.** The Wine cnc-ddraw override is
   obsolete now that SDL3 replaces DirectDraw everywhere. Removed the
   subdirectory, its CMakeLists entry, and the call site in
   `sgp.cpp`'s WinMain.
8. Remove the now-redundant Win32 file I/O stubs from msvc_compat.h.

**Exit criterion**: the non-video, non-input, non-audio parts of SGP
do useful work on non-Windows. File I/O succeeds, the clock advances,
SLF archives load.

---

## Phase 3 — SDL3 window, event loop, and message plumbing

Bring SDL3 in. This is the architectural shift the whole branch is
named after.

**Build system:** ✅ already landed.

- SDL3 is pulled in via `find_package(SDL3 CONFIG)` with a
  `FetchContent` fallback against `release-3.2.16`. Linked to the
  executable on every platform.
- Expat is built from source on every platform now too (the prebuilt
  `libexpatMT.lib` is dropped from the Windows Ja2_Libraries list).
  This means non-Windows builds get a working XML parser without
  any platform-specific binary blobs.

**Source changes:**

1. ✅ Done (minimal): Non-Windows `main()` in [sgp/sgp.cpp](../sgp/sgp.cpp)
   now initializes SDL3, opens a window, runs an `SDL_PollEvent`
   loop that exits on quit / Escape, presents an RGB565
   `SDL_Texture` with a test pattern, and translates
   `SDL_EVENT_KEY_*` / `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_*` events into JA2 event
   codes via a local stub. **Still TODO**: route the translated
   events into JA2's real `QueueEvent`, call `GameLoop` from the
   loop, point the SDL_Texture at the real framebuffer.

**The link-cascade gotcha** (learned the hard way): pulling
JA2_sgp.a's `input.cpp` into the executable's link surface (via
`extern "C" void QueueEvent(...)`) drags ~57 unresolved function
symbols with it -- every video/vsurface/intro/winfont/sound/debug
function that other (un-gated) translation units call. Stubbing all
57 in one shot is fragile (signature mismatches, includes that pull
in DirectDraw types, etc.). The right path is to land the SDL3-
backed rewrites of those subsystems first (Phases 4 proper / 5 /
8 / 9), letting each one delete its `_WIN32` gate as it goes.
Then `QueueEvent` is reachable naturally.

Foundation pieces already in place to support that work:
- [sgp/sgp_non_win32_globals.cpp](../sgp/sgp_non_win32_globals.cpp)
  defines the bare *global variables* that gated subsystems
  exposed via extern. Each phase moves its globals out of this
  stub and into the new SDL3 implementation.
- SDL3, Expat, and Lua 5.1.5 all build from source on every
  platform now; no Windows-only `.lib` blobs in the link path.
2. Replace `MessageBoxW` / `MessageBox` call sites with
   `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox`. ~20-30 sites; mostly in
   FatalError paths.
3. Replace `SetCursor` / `ShowCursor` with
   `SDL_HideCursor` / `SDL_ShowCursor` / `SDL_SetCursor`.
4. Introduce a `Ja2GetWindow()` accessor that returns `SDL_Window*`
   on non-Windows and `HWND` on Windows (or unify on `SDL_Window*`
   and let DirectDraw take it via `SDL_GetWindowProperty`).
5. Replace cnc-ddraw detection logic (the `bCncDdraw` path in
   sgp.cpp) with `SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver()` checks if needed.
6. Honour `iScreenMode` via `SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN` /
   `SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE` etc.

**Exit criterion**: window opens on all three OSes; mouse and
keyboard events route into the event queue; game still renders via
DirectDraw on Windows; game runs to main menu (rendering blank but
not crashing) on macOS.

---

## Phase 4 — SDL3 input

Replace DirectInput / Win32 keyboard & mouse messages with SDL events.

**Status (2026-05-16):** ✅ done end-to-end. SDL_Event → JA2 event
translation lives in [sgp/sdl_input.cpp](../sgp/sdl_input.cpp) +
sdl_input.h. `sgp.cpp`'s main calls `SgpHandleSDLEvent()` which calls
input.cpp's real `QueueEvent` and updates `gfKeyState` /
`gfLeftButtonState` / `gusMouseXPos` / `gsMouseWheelDeltaValue`
directly. The local stderr debug stub is gone.

To clear the 55-symbol link cascade that originally blocked this
wire-up:
1. Stub bodies for video.cpp / vsurface.cpp / Intro.cpp / soundman /
   mousesystem / KeyMap symbols live in
   [sgp/sgp_non_win32_stubs.cpp](../sgp/sgp_non_win32_stubs.cpp) — all
   declared via public headers (vsurface.h, vobject_blitters.h,
   video.h, Intro.h, soundman.h, KeyMap.h, connect.h) so they don't
   need to include `vsurface_private.h` (the one that pulls in
   DirectDraw). As each Phase replaces a subsystem, its stub block
   here gets deleted.
2. 13 cross-library duplicate symbols dedup'd: 9 from
   `Multiplayer/mp_stubs.cpp` (real bodies already exist in JA2 libs;
   stubs removed), and 4 genuine legacy collisions where two
   independent TUs each defined a same-named UI/data global —
   `guiNextButton` / `guiPrevButton` (SaveLoadScreen.cpp vs
   mercs Files.cpp), `GlowColorsA` (mapscreen.cpp vs IMP Gear.cpp,
   different types!), `guiGalleryButton` (florist.cpp vs
   florist Gallery.cpp, scalar vs array) — fixed by making each
   definition `static` since no other TU extern's them.

**Source changes:**

1. [sgp/input.cpp](../sgp/input.cpp) — `KeyboardHandler` /
   `MouseHandler` Win32 hook procs replaced with an
   `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN` / `SDL_EVENT_KEY_UP` /
   `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_*` dispatch driven by Phase 3's `SDL_PollEvent`
   loop. **First cut done** in `sdl_input.cpp` (translation layer);
   full wire-up to `input.cpp::QueueEvent` blocked on Phase 5.
2. [Utils/KeyMap.cpp](../Utils/KeyMap.cpp) — rebuild the keycode
   translation. **The numeric VK_* values must be preserved** for
   savegame compatibility (they're persisted in hotkey config). Build
   a translation table from `SDL_Scancode` to the existing VK_*
   values.
3. Mouse handling: ScreenToClient-style coordinate conversions
   become `SDL_GetMouseState` calls (which already return window-
   coordinate). Drop the `gusMouseXPos` / `gusMouseYPos` shim once
   SDL is authoritative.
4. `SDL_StartTextInput` / `SDL_StopTextInput` around the dialogs
   that take typed names (use `gpCurrentStringDescriptor` as the
   gate signal).
5. Clipboard: `SDL_GetClipboardText` / `SDL_SetClipboardText` in
   [Utils/Text Input.cpp](../Utils/Text%20Input.cpp).
6. Cursor clipping: SDL3 has `SDL_SetWindowMouseRect`. Replace
   `RestrictMouseCursor` / `ClipCursor`-using sites.
7. Delete the `HHOOK ghKeyboardHook` / `ghMouseHook` globals and
   any other Win32-only input plumbing.

**Exit criterion**: keyboard, mouse, and clipboard fully functional
on all three platforms. Game playable through menus.

## Phase 5 — SDL3 video, transitional RGB565

Replace DirectDraw with SDL3 rendering while keeping the existing
RGB565 internal pipeline. **This is the milestone where macOS and
Linux first see pixels.**

**Status (2026-05-16):** first slice landed
([sgp/sdl_video.cpp](../sgp/sdl_video.cpp)). The SDL3 video manager
runs on macOS/Linux only for now — still gated `#ifndef _WIN32` while
the legacy DirectDraw `video.cpp` keeps Windows working. Flipping
Windows over to the same SDL3 path is the next slice (Phase 5b
below).

**Source changes:**

1. ~~Rewrite [sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp) — at this scale,
   easier to rewrite than to port.~~ **Done as
   [sgp/sdl_video.cpp](../sgp/sdl_video.cpp).** Public API
   preserved: InitializeVideoManager / Lock(Frame|Back|Primary|Mouse)Buffer /
   InvalidateRegion(s|Ex|Screen) / RefreshScreen / Set8BPPPalette /
   GetCurrentVideoSettings / GetPrimaryRGBDistributionMasks /
   StartFrameBufferRender / EndFrameBufferRender / VideoCaptureToggle /
   PrintScreen / FatalError / EraseMouseCursor /
   SetMouseCursorProperties / etc. Heap UINT16* buffers behind the
   Lock entry points; `SDL_UpdateTexture` + `RenderTexture` +
   `RenderPresent` in RefreshScreen.
2. Same treatment for [sgp/vsurface.cpp](../sgp/vsurface.cpp).
   **Done as [sgp/sdl_vsurface.cpp](../sgp/sdl_vsurface.cpp)**.
   - Pure-C++ pieces (ClipRectangle, SurfaceData registries).
   - SGPVSurface manager: NewSurface/DeleteVideoSurface lifecycle;
     SetPrimaryVideoSurfaces wraps the four heap buffers
     sdl_video.cpp owns; InitializeVideoSurfaceManager /
     ShutdownVideoSurfaceManager; AddStandardVideoSurface /
     CreateVideoSurface (empty + from-file via HIMAGE/CopyImageToBuffer);
     GetVideoSurface / GetVideoSurfaceDescription /
     DeleteVideoSurfaceFromIndex; Lock/UnLockVideoSurface (dispatches
     PRIMARY/BACK/FRAME/MOUSE to sdl_video.cpp's Lock*Buffer);
     SetVideoSurfaceTransparency / Palette / GetVSurfacePaletteEntries;
     Region-list helpers.
   - CPU blitters: BltVideoSurfaceToVideoSurface (memcpy + colour-key
     loop), BltVideoSurface (Get + dispatch), BltStretchVideoSurface
     (nearest-neighbour), BltVSurfaceUsingDD (alias to the CPU blit
     path), ColorFillVideoSurfaceArea (direct rect fill).
   - Still returning FALSE: ImageFillVideoSurfaceArea (tile-fill),
     the ShadowVideoSurface* family (alpha shadow blends). These
     wait for Phase 6's RGB565 blender retirement.
3. ~~Delete [sgp/DirectDraw Calls.cpp](../sgp/DirectDraw%20Calls.cpp),
   [sgp/DirectX Common.cpp](../sgp/DirectX%20Common.cpp),
   [sgp/ddraw.h](../sgp/ddraw.h), `ddraw.lib`.~~ **Done** (Phase 5b
   commit 0271f6d9). The .cpp files are removed from sgpSrc;
   ddraw.lib dropped from the Windows Ja2_Libraries link list.
   sgp/ddraw.h still on disk but no longer referenced.
4. Delete cnc-ddraw detection (the `bCncDdraw` path). **Pending**
   — lives inside `WinMain` which gets rewritten in the WinMain-on-
   SDL_main slice.
5. ~~Delete the `ADDTEXT_16BPP_REQUIRED` error path~~ **Done
   implicitly** — sdl_video.cpp doesn't have it.
6. The inline-asm RGB565 alpha blender at
   [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp:19-60](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp#L19-L60)
   needs replacement with portable C — keep RGB565 math, just stop
   using `__asm`. **Pending** — current `_WIN32` gating means the
   asm only kicks in on MSVC, so non-Windows builds already use the
   portable fallback. Phase 6 retires it entirely.

### Phase 5b — structural flip: SDL3 is the only video path (✅ done 2026-05-16)

Commits `0271f6d9` (the structural flip) + `ed98c9b6` (rename
sgp_non_win32_* → sgp_portable_*). User signaled they're not
verifying the Windows build for now — the flip is purely structural,
intended to make the codebase architecturally correct ("SDL3
everywhere") while macOS continues to be the verification platform.

What landed:

1. ~~Drop the `#ifndef _WIN32` body gate from `sdl_video.cpp`~~ done.
   No HINSTANCE-overload added — the WinMain rewrite below makes
   that overload unnecessary, so we just drop it.
2. ~~Remove `sgp/video.cpp`, `sgp/vsurface.cpp`,
   `sgp/DirectDraw Calls.cpp`, `sgp/DirectX Common.cpp` from
   `sgpSrc`.~~ done.
3. ~~Add `sdl_video.cpp` + `sgp_portable_globals.cpp` +
   `sgp_portable_stubs.cpp` to `sgpSrc` unconditionally.~~ done.
4. ~~Drop `ddraw.lib` from the Windows `Ja2_Libraries` list.~~ done.
5. ~~`WinMain` in [sgp/sgp.cpp](../sgp/sgp.cpp) at ~line 690 still owns
   ~900 lines of Win32 plumbing.~~ **Done** (commit `e2e93b60`).
   `WinMain` / `HandledWinMain` / `WindowProcedure` /
   `SyncWindowProcedure` / `CreateStandardGamingPlatform` /
   `SGPExceptionFilter` retired (gated `#if 0` for archeology).
   `InitializeStandardGamingPlatform` is no-arg now; the void
   `InitializeVideoManager` is the only video init.
   `RegisterWindowMessage(MSH_MOUSEWHEEL)` gone (SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_WHEEL).
   `CRITICAL_SECTION gcsGameLoop` → `std::mutex gGameLoopMutex`.
   `__try`/`__except` SEH replaced by plain `try`/`catch` in
   `SafeSGPExit` + `CallGameLoop`. `SGPExit` MessageBox → stderr.
   Win32 `GetCommandLineW` parse rewritten as portable argc/argv
   scan. Unified `int main(int, char**)` drives `SDL_PollEvent` +
   `CallGameLoop` directly. macOS arm64 build clean; Windows builds
   need to absorb the remaining `_WIN32`-only references in
   WinFont/vobject_blitters as part of items 6+7 below.
6. `WinFont.cpp`'s DD-using GDI text-rendering block
   ([sgp/WinFont.cpp:425-466](../sgp/WinFont.cpp#L425-L466)) calls
   `GetVideoSurfaceDDSurface` / `IDirectDrawSurface2_GetDC` /
   `TextOutW` — disable this block (the SDL_ttf / stb_truetype Phase
   9 replacement gives portable text rendering). Currently still
   `#ifdef _WIN32`-gated; will fail to compile on Windows now that
   the DD getters are gone, but Windows builds aren't being verified.
7. `vobject_blitters.cpp` inline-asm blocks. 14 ports landed so
   far (commits `800f2bc2` through `6d7a6450`):
   - `blendWithAlpha` (real RGB565 alpha math)
   - `Blt16BPPTo16BPP`, `Blt16BPPTo16BPPMirror` (16bpp opaque /
     mirror memcpy)
   - `Blt8BPPTo8BPP` (8bpp row memcpy)
   - `Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransparent{,Clip}` (UI sprite,
     unclipped + clipped)
   - `Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransZ{,NB,Clip,NBClip}` (Z-tested
     sprite, with/without Z update, unclipped + clipped -- workhorse
     for game-world tile rendering)
   - `Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferTransMirror` (left/right sprite flip)
   - `Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferMonoShadowClip` (font rasterizer
     glyph blit)
   - `Blt8BPPDataTo16BPPBufferShadowZ{,NB,Clip,NBClip}` (Z-tested
     darken via ShadeTable[], with/without Z update, unclipped +
     clipped -- merc/object shadows)

   Convention adopted commit `9928b26f`: drop the `#ifdef _WIN32`
   gating entirely when porting. The asm bodies are dead code on
   every platform we're building (clang doesn't support MSVC
   inline asm; Windows isn't being verified), so future ports just
   delete the asm block and paste a portable ETRLE decoder where
   it was. Typical diff: ~30 lines added, ~170 lines removed.

   ~62 inline-asm blocks remain. The pattern is now fully
   mechanical (each is the same ETRLE row decoder skeleton with
   different per-pixel logic + a Z-test variant); future sessions
   can crank through them.

**Exit criterion (Phase 5 full)**: game boots into main menu on all
three platforms and renders correctly via the existing RGB565
pipeline. End-to-end at least one battle playable.

---

## Phase 6 — RGBA8888 pipeline conversion

Now that everything routes through SDL, swap the internal pixel
format.

1. Change `PIXEL_DEPTH` in [Ja2/local.h](../Ja2/local.h) from 16 to 32.
2. Wide-rename `UINT16* pBuffer` → `UINT32* pBuffer` across every
   blitter and caller. Adjust pitch math (bytes-per-pixel doubles).
3. Regenerate the 8bpp→32bpp palette LUTs in
   [sgp/himage.cpp](../sgp/himage.cpp). The shading, fade-to-black,
   fade-to-white, translucency, and night-vision tables in
   [sgp/shading.cpp](../sgp/shading.cpp) all need RGBA8888
   equivalents.
4. Rewrite every blitter in
   [sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp](../sgp/vobject_blitters.cpp) — there
   are dozens of variants (TransZ, TransZNB, TransZClip,
   TransZTranslucent, MonoShadow, Pixelate, …). Drop the inline asm.
5. Replace the inline-asm `blendWithAlpha` and every other RGB565
   bit-math site with portable C (consider SDL_SIMD intrinsics).
6. Update SDL texture format to `SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ARGB8888` or
   matching endianness.
7. Update saveable surfaces / screenshot writers
   ([sgp/video.cpp](../sgp/video.cpp) TGA path).
8. Z-buffer stays `UINT16` (it's a depth value, not a color).

**Risk**: this is the phase where game-rendering regressions hide.
Plan golden-image regression testing — render a known scene under
Phase 5 (tag the commit) vs Phase 6, diff the buffers.

**Exit criterion**: game is visually identical (or better) to Phase 5
on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 7 — Audio: SFX & music

Replace FMOD / Miles Sound System.

- Pick: SDL3_mixer vs SoLoud vs miniaudio. Bias toward SDL3_mixer
  (already on SDL3). Audit feature coverage first — positional audio?
  arbitrary channel counts? low-latency triggering?
- Replace [sgp/soundman.cpp](../sgp/soundman.cpp) backend; keep public
  API stable.
- Audit MSS-isms in [sgp/Mss.h](../sgp/Mss.h) / `Mss-old.h` — many
  call signatures are MSS-shaped (`HSAMPLE`/`HSTREAM` handles);
  these become opaque pointers backed by the new engine.
- Music streaming (Ogg/MP3) — ensure file-format support matches
  what the game ships.
- Delete `fmodvc.lib` linkage.

**Exit criterion**: SFX and music on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 8 — Cinematics

- Replace Smacker decoding with [libsmacker](https://libsmacker.sourceforge.net/)
  (open-source, MIT-licensed, decodes original Smacker format).
- Bink: drop, or convert assets to Smacker/WebM, or use FFmpeg if
  licensing allows. Decision deferred until we audit which assets
  are which.
- Render decoded video frames into an `SDL_Texture` and present.
- Delete `binkw32.lib` / `SMACKW32.LIB` linkage.

**Exit criterion**: cinematics play (or are gracefully skipped) on
all three platforms.

---

## Phase 9 — Fonts & GDI cleanup

- Replace [sgp/WinFont.cpp](../sgp/WinFont.cpp) with stb_truetype
  (single-header, public domain).
- Most of the game uses pre-rendered bitmap fonts shipped in the
  asset bundle, so this code path is only used in a few places
  (mod-added text, debug overlays).

**Exit criterion**: all text renders on all three platforms.

---

## Phase 10 — Platform packaging & CI

- macOS: `.app` bundle, code-signing config (unsigned for now),
  resource path resolution via `SDL_GetBasePath`.
- Linux: AppImage (initially).
- Windows: keep existing installer flow; produce a zip artifact too.
- CI matrix: build all three on every PR. At minimum "configures &
  compiles". Ideally a headless boot smoke test.

---

## Open questions / decisions still pending

1. **Lua 5.1 vs Lua 5.4** — the master-branch TODO mentions building
   Lua from source. JA2 mods may depend on 5.1 semantics. Default:
   stay on 5.1.x source build, defer any version bump.
2. **Multiplayer long-term** — RakNet 4 port, SDL3_net swap, or just
   leave it Windows-only forever? Question for the maintainers.
3. **Editor builds** — JA2MAPEDITOR / JA2UBMAPEDITOR targets must
   keep building. Should they share the SDL3 surface or stay legacy?
4. **Threading** — once Phase 2 ports Timer Control to std::thread,
   audit other `CreateThread` / `_beginthread` usage. Saw a few in
   sgp.cpp's WindowProcedure.
5. **Save format compatibility** — must not change. Worth a fuzz
   round-trip test before merging Phase 6.

## Reference: upstream prior art

- [ja2-stracciatella](https://github.com/ja2-stracciatella/ja2-stracciatella) —
  ported the *original* JA2 to SDL2 over ~10 years. Their video,
  input, audio, and filesystem layers are useful reference but can't
  be copied wholesale — they diverged from the 1.13 lineage long ago
  and 1.13's feature surface is dramatically larger. License is
  compatible (SFI-1.0 / GPL-style); attribution required if we lift
  specific code.
- [facebookarchive/RakNet](https://github.com/facebookarchive/RakNet)
  — RakNet 4.081, the only public RakNet source. JA2 uses 3.401
  which has incompatible API; see Multiplayer section.
- [libsdl-org/SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) — SDL3, latest
  release.
- [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) — stb_truetype for
  Phase 9.
- [libsmacker](https://libsmacker.sourceforge.net/) — Phase 8 Smacker
  replacement.

---

## Commit log shape

Roughly 50 commits on `sdl3-port` past `master` at the close of
Phase 1. Each commit is scoped to a small, reviewable change with a
concrete message. The first commits (Phase 0/1 baseline) and the
final Phase 1 close are easy to identify in the log. The middle is a
long sequence of clang-strictness fixes and Win32-gating commits;
they could be squashed before merging upstream if desired, but the
granularity is handy for bisecting regressions.
